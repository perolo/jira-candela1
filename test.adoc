= Requirements
:experimental:

This is a proposal for how we could reference requirements from our ascii doc documentation.

== Process idea

Requirements are managed and owned in an external system: Jira.
To be able to reference and make sure that the software documentation is updated with the latest requirements a "pre-processor" step to the generation of documentation is proposed.

By adding a specific "encoding" of a "text" in the document that is replaced at "pre" compiletime

This enables that if the requirement has been updated in Jira the old "wording" is replaced with the new and the difference is possible to review in the PR.

If Jira is deprecated, the information is still maintained locally with the code


== Examples


<CC-202>

<CC-205:When the SW detects a severe malfunction it shall transition to  the System Safe State>

<CC-202:The P12 SW needs to be approved by DNV as a SW developed with documented development process>


.An example table
[options="header"]
|=======================
|Col 1|Col 2      |Col 3
|1    |<CC-202:The P12 SW needs to be approved by DNV as a SW developed with documented development process>     |a
|2    |Item 2     |b
|3    |Item 3     |c
|6    |Three items|d
|=======================

== Future Improvements

Also adding an hyperlink to the issue?


.Additional possible customization/formatting features possible:
* N : Get the Summary from Jira (Name)
* D : Get the description from jira
* S : Get the status of the jira issue
* H : Add the hyperlink

== Examples Future Improvements

<REQ-2:NDH> =>
<https://candela-boats.atlassian.net/browse/REQ-2[REQ-2:NDH:An example requirement, with some additional detail]>


<REQ-2:NS> =>
<REQ-2:NS:An example requirement kbd:[APPROVED]>
